# 🐞 Buggy To-Do List — Debugging Exercise

Welcome!  
This is a small **JavaScript DOM manipulation** project... with a twist:  
There are **intentional bugs** hidden in the code.  
Your mission is to **find them** 🕵️‍♀️ and **fix the app** so it works properly.  

---

## 🎯 Goal
- Get the To-Do List app running without errors.  
- Make sure you can:
  1. Add tasks.  
  2. Mark tasks as complete/incomplete.  
  3. Delete tasks.  

---

## 🛠 Skills You’ll Practice
- **DOM manipulation** (`document.getElementById`, `createElement`, `appendChild`, etc.)  
- **JavaScript logic** (loops, conditionals, array methods)  
- **Event handling** (`addEventListener`, `.onclick`)  
- **Debugging** (reading errors, using browser DevTools)

## 📦 Project Setup

### Option 1 — Fork & Edit on GitHub
1. Go to the project repository link your teacher provided.  
2. Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner of the GitHub page.  
   - This makes your own **copy** of the project under your GitHub account.  
3. Open your forked repository.  
4. Click the **"Code"** button, then:
   - Either **Download ZIP** and open it locally.  
   - Or **Copy the HTTPS/SSH URL** to clone with Git.  

### Option 2 — Edit Locally
1. Download the project as a `.zip` file.  
2. Extract the `.zip` file to a folder.  
3. Open the folder in **VS Code** or your favorite editor.  
4. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.  

---

## 🧠 How to Work on It
1. Open **Developer Tools** in your browser (`F12` or right-click → Inspect).  
2. Look in the **Console** tab for JavaScript errors.  
3. Read the error messages — they tell you what’s wrong and where to look.  
4. Open `script.js` in your editor and fix one bug at a time.  
5. Refresh the browser after each change to see if it works.  

---

## 💡 Hints
- JavaScript is **case-sensitive**  
- Pay close attention to **`=` vs `==` vs `===`**.  
- Watch out for **off-by-one errors** in loops.  
- When deleting items from an array, check the arguments  

---

## 📜 Extra Challenge (Optional)
Once your To-Do List works:
- Add an **Edit** button so you can change a task.  
- Add a **counter** that shows how many tasks remain.  
- Save tasks in `localStorage` so they stay after a page refresh.
