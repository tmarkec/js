# 🐞 Buggy To-Do List — Debugging Exercise

Welcome!  
This is a small **JavaScript DOM manipulation** project... with a twist:  
There are **intentional bugs** hidden in the code.  
Your mission is to **find them** 🕵️‍♀️ and **fix the app** so it works properly.  

---

## 🎯 Goal
- Get the To-Do List app running without errors.  
- Make sure you can:
  1. Add tasks.  
  2. Mark tasks as complete/incomplete.  
  3. Delete tasks.  

---

## 🛠 Skills You’ll Practice
- **DOM manipulation** (`document.getElementById`, `createElement`, `appendChild`, etc.)  
- **JavaScript logic** (loops, conditionals, array methods)  
- **Event handling** (`addEventListener`, `.onclick`)  
- **Debugging** (reading errors, using browser DevTools)

## 📦 Project Setup

### Before you start coding
First you need to either **[clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)** this repository, to work on the code in your local environment. Or you can **[fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)** it to your own GitHub account and then open it in a cloud-based code editor (or even clone it from there).

---

## 🧠 How to Work on It
1. Open **Developer Tools** in your browser (`F12` or right-click → Inspect).  
2. Look in the **Console** tab for JavaScript errors.  
3. Read the error messages — they tell you what’s wrong and where to look.  
4. Open `script.js` in your editor and fix one bug at a time.  
5. Refresh the browser after each change to see if it works.  

---

## 💡 Hints
- JavaScript is **case-sensitive**  
- Pay close attention to **`=` vs `==` vs `===`**.  
- Watch out for **off-by-one errors** in loops.  
- When deleting items from an array, check the arguments  

---

## 📜 Extra Challenge (Optional)
Once your To-Do List works:
- Add an **Edit** button so you can change a task.  
- Add a **counter** that shows how many tasks remain.  
- Save tasks in `localStorage` so they stay after a page refresh.
